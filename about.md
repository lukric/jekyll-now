My name is Lukas and currently I am working and living in Vienna. I have an MSc (in Austria it's called "Diplom Ingenieur") in *Mathematics*. After university I started working at the department of infectious disease epidemiology at the [Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES)](https://www.ages.at). Luckily my employer gives me the opportunity to do a PhD in cooperation with the University of Technology in Graz using lots of my AGES-related projects.
